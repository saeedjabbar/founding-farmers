# 🚀 Getting started with Strapi

## Timeline entries have their own collection type

Stories previously embedded repeatable timeline components. They now reference the dedicated `timeline-entry` collection, which stores `entryDate`, `headline`, `body`, optional `position`, and a many-to-many link to records. Update any local data fixtures to use the relation instead of the deprecated component.

To migrate existing component data from older environments:

```
npm run strapi ts-node ./scripts/migrate-timeline-entries.ts
```

The helper will:

- read legacy component rows (`components_timeline_timeline_entries`) and their join tables
- create `timeline-entry` records for stories that do not already have migrated milestones
- copy the Blocks body, order, and related records

Verify the resulting entries in the admin UI, then drop legacy component tables once you are satisfied. The script is idempotent—it skips stories that already contain timeline entries so it is safe to re-run after fixing data issues.

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.
